# Elixir Jobs

Elixir Jobs is a job board based in Elixir + Phoenix.

## Technologies used

- Erlang
- Elixir
- Phoenix
- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL

Some of the versions are set on `.tool_versions` file, so you can use it with [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)

## Start the project

The project should be installed and set up like any other elixir project.

```
$ cd elixir_jobs
$ mix deps.get
$ mix ecto.create
$ mix ecto.migrate
```

You might encounter some errors about the secrets files. That's because you need to copy the template files under `./config` and personalise them with your local configuration.

Also, assets now live on `./assets`, so NPM and brunch configurations are there.

### Seeds

The project has the model of Administrators, which take care of approving the offers before showing them on the site.

You can create a dummy administration user (credetials: dummy@user.com / 123456)  using the seeds:

```
$ mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
```
